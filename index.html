Last year I worked for the University of Michigan's Academic Success Program, tutoring students in mathematics & computer science. For the past year, I have been a member of an organization called GEECS - Girls in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. And periodically, I volunteer with UM's Women in Science & Engineering program to put on workshops for high school girls learning to code, or with FEMMES (Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science), teaching elementary school girls that mathematics, science, and engineering can be exciting and fun.
